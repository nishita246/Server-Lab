1. CGI vs Servlets
Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
CGI is a standard protocol that enables web servers to execute external scripts and generate dynamic content. It is mostly written in languages like Python, Perl, or C.

Disadvantages of CGI:
- Performance Issues – Every request spawns a new process, leading to high memory and CPU usage.
- Slow Execution – The overhead of creating and destroying processes reduces efficiency.
- Security Risks – External scripts pose a security risk if not properly handled.

Java Servlets
Java Servlets are Java programs that run on the server to handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic web content.

Advantages of Servlets over CGI:
- Efficient & Scalable – Unlike CGI, Servlets run within a single JVM process, reducing overhead.
- Better Memory Management – Uses threads instead of separate processes.
- Platform-Independent – Since Servlets are written in Java, they can run on any platform with a Java-supported web server.
- Security – Better security mechanisms with authentication, authorization, and session management.
